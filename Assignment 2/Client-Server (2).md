# Yatzy Game Client-Server
  

 
  
#### Server Setup Steps
- The first step is to create constant variables such as the server port and the pathway
- Then set the pathway directory as public
- Afterwards a path request is sent to the console
- And then another request is sent with the dice calculation logic from the previous game code file
- Then adding the rest of the specific types of scoring functions to the server side from the previous game code file

### API Endpoint Usages
- Retrieve the current roll and round numbers
- Update the user's roll number
- Reset the game

### Other Information
The code to create the client-server logic is written in a new JavaScript file called dicemodule.js. The other two files for the assignment are game.js and play.html. Functions from game.js (the original game logic code) were implemented for the client-server assignment.
